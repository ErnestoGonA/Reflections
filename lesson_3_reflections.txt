When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When I need to have a copy of the repository so I can share it with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because sometimes to launch a new characteristic or a version of the app, it takes more
  than one commit, and only the person will know when you want to share the changes of the
  project.
