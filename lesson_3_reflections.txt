When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When I need to have a copy of the repository so I can share it with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Because sometimes to launch a new characteristic or a version of the app, it takes more
  than one commit, and only the person will know when you want to share the changes of the
  project

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead 
of another?

  A branch is a diferent path that follows the repository, its convenient to use branches when
  you wanto to make modifications of the code without messing the production code.
  A clone is a copy of a repository from GitHub located in your computer. It could be used when
  you need to work on a project and make modifications of the code locally and publish it when
  you have done the work.
  A fork is a copy of a repositoro from GitHub in your own account of GitHub. Its usefull when 
  you don't have permision of push to one public repository but you want to make changes and 
  share them.
