What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    The hiden directory .git is created, this contains metadata of the history of the 
    changes in the files of the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    In the staging area you put the files that you changes that contain the modifications
    that you consider that must be together in one commit, besides the working directory, that
    contains all the files of your repository.
    It's very valuable because having this, you can decide what to add in a commit and keep more
    clean your commits

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

    You can add separately the files to the staging area, then make a commit just with the files
    that represent the logical change to commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

    When you want to try to add a new feature but you have to do some tests before release to the
    production version, also when you want to do some experimental changes.
    With branches you can make a "copy" of the repository where you can make all the changes without 
    messing the master branch.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

    You can find what changes are made in all the branches and see where a new branch was created to see
    what features will contain.
    Also you can see the reachability of the commits of the branches by identifing what is the parent of 
    each commit.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
